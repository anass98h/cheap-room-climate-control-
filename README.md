The goal of this project is to make a cheap climate control with motion sensor that can double as security system
This IoT device will show if the room is too hot or too cold, or too humid by LED and if it's red you can check through the dashboard

Estimated time to complete: 30 min without a dashboard and 1,5h with dashboard

## Objective
why I choose to make this: it's because climate change is catching up with us fast, and we just had a brutally hot summer
in Sweden and it has affected my sleep a lot because the housing in Sweden is isolated for cold winters the air
the outside might be cold, but the apartment will keep the heat it stored in the morning
with the help of this device i can tell when I walk into the room if it's too room climate is suitable for sleep
if it's not i can view through the dashboard what's wrong and crack a window or turn on the humidifier
