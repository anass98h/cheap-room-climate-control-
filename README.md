The goal of this project is to make a cheap climate contral with motion sensor that can duoble as security system
This IOT device will show if the room is too hot or too cold or too humid by LED and if its red you can check through the dashboard

Estimated time to complete: 30 min without dashboard and 1,5h with dashboard

## Objective
why i choose to make this: it's beacuse climate change is catching up with us fast and we just had a brutally hot summer
in sweden and it has effected my sleep alot because the housing in sweden is isolated for cold winters the air
outside might be cold but the apartent will keep the het it stored in the morning
with the help of this divice i can tell when i walk into the room if its too room climate is sutible for sleep
if its not i can viwe through the dashoard what's worng and crack a window or turn on the humidifier
